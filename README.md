# Active Learning Graph Research 

This repository contains research code exploring the role of **negative edges in graph-based learning and analysis**. Traditional graph methods often treat all edges as positive, but in many real-world datasets (e.g., social networks, biological systems, recommendation systems), **negative relationships** carry crucial information.  

The work presented here demonstrates how incorporating negative edges affects learning tasks, model performance, and graph structure understanding.
